      <p>
        I’m a developer with over 10 years of experience. I have worked both as
        a freelancer and in couple of agencies and have a reputation for having
        a keen eye for details and for delivering products on time. In early
        2020 I created a company, ljomi GmbH and I work since then as a
        self-employed.

      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>
        I’m serious about markup. The structure that lies underneath every
        websites. Well crafted markup can do a lot of good for any website and
        is essential for responsive web design, findability in search engines
        and for accessibility. I pay great attention to the details and I make
        sure that everything is in its right place. Get a

      <h3>Free time</h3>
      <p>
        In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with open source
        <a class="link" href="https://github.com/ingvoo">projects</a> and to
        teach teenagers how to develop and design for the web. When offline I do
        yoga, run, make music or most likely spend time and playing games with
        my family. I love

        and having music in a physical form is very important to me. Playing
        music as a dj used to be a big part of my life but has lately taken a
        back seat as a past time hobby.
