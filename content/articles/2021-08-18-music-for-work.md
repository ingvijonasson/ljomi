title: Music for work
summary: The music I listen to when I need to focus
---
Sometimes I need quite surrounding when I work. Then I do not need music. Then as well there are days where I want to be in a very particular work flow. Then I need my focus playlist. My list contains only instrumental songs and a mixture of electronic and accoustic music. It's not this kind of a loungy endless vibe going on but a bit more random stuff. I play the selection quite often as it works very well for me to have solid songs that I do not get bored of and I generally do not get into a flow while listening to music I have not heard before but it happens sometimes and of course then I add the music to my playlist. It might be something you like and it might not but I hope you enjoy it as well.
