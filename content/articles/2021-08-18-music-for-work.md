title: Music for work
summary: The music I listen to when I need to focus
published: true

There are days where I want to be in a very particular work flow where I play my focus list. The list contains instrumental songs and a mixture of electronic and live music. No lounge vibe going here but more of random stuff from different genres. I play the selection quite often as it works very well for me to have solid songs that I do not get easily bored of and to listen to music that I already know. I hope you can enjoy it as well.
