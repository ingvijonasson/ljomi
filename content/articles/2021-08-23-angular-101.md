title: Angular 101
summary: Note tacking some angular concepts and syntax
---
@Inputs are in Angular same as props in Vue.js. Inputs are decorators and are called just like functions.

``` 
@Component({
  selector: 'app-button';
  // ...
})

export class AppButtonComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() type
  
  constructor() {}
  noOnInit(): void {}
}
```

Then this component which is expecting the input might look like this.

`<app-button [type]="primary"></app-button>`
