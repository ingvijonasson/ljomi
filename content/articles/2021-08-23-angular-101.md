summary: Note tacking some angular concepts and syntax

@Inputs are in Angular same as props in Vue.js. Inputs are decorators and are called just like functions.

``` 
@Component({
  selector: 'app-button';
  // ...
})

export class AppButtonComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() type
  
  constructor() {}
  noOnInit(): void {}
}
```

A component that is expecting an input might look like this where the `type` is an @Input():

`<app-button [type]="primary"></app-button>`
