## Inputs

`@Inputs()` in Angular act similar as props in Vue.js. Inputs are decorators and are called just like functions. When inputs are passed they appear in brackets but generally bindings are also in brackets.

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-button';
  // ...
})

export class AppButtonComponent {
  @Input() type

  constructor() {}
}
```

Then the component which is expecting an input might look like this in a parent template.

```html
<app-button [type]="primary"></app-button>
```

## Outputs

The parenthesis are for events or outputs. Here the brackets on the `<form>` are bindings and not an input. An output is a way to pass something up to a parent component or to emitting events known in Vue.js.

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-habit-form',
  template: `
    <form [formGroup]="habitForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(habitForm.value)">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Add habit" formControlName="title" />
      <button type="submit">Add</button>
    </form>
  `,
})
export class HabitFormComponent {
  habitForm: any;
  @Output() addHabit = new EventEmitter<any>();

  onSubmit(newHabit) {
    this.addHabit.emit(newHabit);
    this.habitForm.reset();
  }
}
```

The form emits the newly created habit to its parent where it catches the new item and adds it to an array.

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-habit-list',
  template: `
    <app-habit-form (addHabit)="onAddHabit($event)"></app-habit-form>
  `,
})
export class HabitListComponent {
  habits = [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'Check in with parents once a week',
    },
    // ...
  ]

  constructor() {}

  onAddHabit(newHabit) {
    newHabit.id = this.habits.length + 1
    this.habits.push(newHabit)
  }
}
```

## Services

Services are for storing data and methods for working with the data. Or a way to store and share data throughout the application similar to the Vue store or Vuex.
