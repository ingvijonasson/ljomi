summary: Let's have a look at the web landscape on how toggletips are implemented

So first let's discuss what are toggletips. These are the small containers that appear when e.g. a user clicks a button. This is very similar to tooltips but without being a tooltip.

Bootstrap does this with some accessibility in mind and Foundation takes it a bit further. But the results are not really satisfying but I found the foundation solution to be pretty perfect aside fromt that a live region is missing.
