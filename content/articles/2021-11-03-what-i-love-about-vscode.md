Here are my favorite commands within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

* `cmd` + `p` go to file or to look up or open any file
* `cmd` + `shift` + `p` open the command pallette
Along with previous command this is probably the most important shortcut for me. Inside the command pallette you can run any task, change your preferences such as changing your color syntax.
* `ctrl` + `r` to change projects or enviroment
I sometimes work on multiple projects or repos and with this command you can move between theses quickly without closing any tabs or needing to do anything. Your enviroment stays the same when you come back. You need to save all your changes though before moving away from a project.

VSCode has a great deal of extensions available. I use quite a bit of extensions. Although these commands I mentioned above are available out of the box by default.
