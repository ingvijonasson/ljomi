The focus ring is that blue border outline around the currently focused element on the site your are visiting. Unfortunately designers and developers often remove this feature and therefore break the experience for many users.

The reason why they might do so is probably because the outline does not align with the visual design or the identity of the brand. What seems also to be a common approach is to style the outline very minimal. So instead of removing the outline the focus state gets very minimal styles. So basically the focus style is in place but done in a way that it is hard to see it and also to follow when navigating with the keyboard.

The approach I like to follow is to make the focus ring look good and also prominent and to apply it to all interactive elements by default. Basically make it very visible when navigating.

```css
a[href]:focus,
area[href]:focus,
input:not([disabled]):focus,
select:not([disabled]):focus,
textarea:not([disabled]):focus,
button:not([disabled]):focus,
[tabindex='0']:focus {
  /* styles for your ring */
}
```

A great example can be found on the [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) site. At the time of writing the site has a very prominent dotted outline for almost all interactive elements. If you visit the site, use the tab key to navigate the site and see the prominent blue outline.

## When the default does not work

There will be instances where the ring might look less good or sometimes even awkward. In these cases you might want to come up with better visuals for the focused element. This might be the site brand or the site logo or you might want to style focused form elements differently than other interactive elements.
This could be changing text color, background color, adding underlines or custom borders and a combination of these.

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="css,result" data-slug-hash="abLPdyr" data-preview="true" data-editable="true" data-user="ingvoo" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

## Conclusion

The focus ring is there in your browser by default. Letâ€™s not break the experience and therefore never remove it. By prioritizing the focus ring styles for all interactive elements and improving it's style you do prioritise the user experience and foster accessibility. Then when needed adjust the experience for the elements that need a different styles.
