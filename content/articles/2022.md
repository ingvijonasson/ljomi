## Learn with Jason

- [Letâ€™s Learn Eleventy! (with Zach Leatherman)](https://youtu.be/j8mJrhhdHWc) 
Zach is the creator of Eleventy. Great way to get started and see how simple it is to start an Eleventy site.

## NTS Radio

- [24.01.22 Rahill](https://www.nts.live/shows/rahill/episodes/rahill-24th-january-2022)
Excellent jazz selection.
