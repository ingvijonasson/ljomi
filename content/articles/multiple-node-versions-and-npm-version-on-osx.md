N is great it installs node on your machine and gives you the capability to change node versions in matter of seconds. I have been using N since a couple of years on multiple machinens and have never since then consider not using it.

N is a cruzial feature to devolpers working with different projects and enviroments where different node versions are required.

## Changing your npm version

N installs your node versions and it comes with npm as well. If you need to change your npm version run npm install -g npm@next-6
