I have had the pleasure to work with Ingvi first as a colleague at Liip and a second time as a contractor with lj√≥mi. We were creating a component framework with Angular and brought Ingvi in to help us manage the "style side" of things in regards to best practices, cross browser- and device-compatibility, accessibility and scalability. Ingvi joined our team during the Covid-19 lockdown and despite the circumstances, quickly acquainted himself with the project and took on his role in the team. His calm manner and meticulous eye for detail as well as his expert subject knowledge played an elemental role in delivering the product on time. I hope our paths cross again both professionally and outside of the office!
