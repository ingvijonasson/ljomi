During both our time at Ginetta, it was a pleasure to work with Ingvi. He is extremely knowledgable on good, semantic and accessible HTML/CSS and he clearly has a passion for doing things correctly. He was one of the main accessibility advocates at the company, and he is a very good teacher. Everyone should have an Ingvi on their team.
